			<h1>OB Hot Soup project is starting soon</h1>
			<p>
We are waiting the delivery of a big restaurant grade soup thermos so we can deliver hot soup to the site.
You can organize your own 'soup party' or volunteer on a soup team. 
Organizers will find or make some soup. There are many ways to participate. Signing up here doesn't commit you to volunteering; we will let 
you know when we start up. Volunteers will be needed to:  
<ul>
	<li>setup - get thermos to soup kitchen</li>
	<li>cook - soup </li>
	<li>deliver - pickup from kitchen and deliver to OB</li>
	<li>retrieve - thermos to group so we can do it again</li>
</ul>	
			</p>
			<a href="launch.php" class="signup_button round">get notified when OBHotSoup begins</a>
